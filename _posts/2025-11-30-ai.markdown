Everyone talks about AI. I am using AI, we are forced to use AI at work. AI is helpful _sometimes_. But I am strong believer that you barely can learn anything if you just rely on AI. AI can be confidently wrong. AI tries to please you all the time.
Use your critical thinking skills while you still have it. Talk to real people, they will give you honest opinion.

There, I said it.
